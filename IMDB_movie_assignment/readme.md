IMDB_movie_assignment_Upgrad

For my IMDB movie assignment as part of the PG Diploma program with Upgrad and IIIT Bengaluru, I’m analyzing the top 100 rated movies from the past decade. 
The task involves exploring various aspects of the movies, including details about the actors and voters. 
Using Python, I’ll derive insights by performing data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. 
The assignment requires a thorough understanding of the dataset, and each task has specific instructions to follow for correct analysis.
I’m focusing on writing clear code and interpreting data effectively to generate meaningful insights.
