Credit EDA Case study

1. This case study focuses on applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a real-world business scenario, specifically within risk analytics for banking and financial services. 
2. It explores the challenges loan providers face when assessing applicants with insufficient or no credit history, which can lead to defaults. 
3. As a consumer finance company analyst, youâ€™ll use EDA to identify patterns that help distinguish applicants likely to repay their loans from those who may default. 
4. The goal is to minimize financial loss by understanding how consumer and loan attributes influence repayment behavior. 
5. By identifying high-risk applicants, the company can take actions like denying loans or adjusting terms to mitigate potential losses.
